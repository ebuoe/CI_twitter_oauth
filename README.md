Copy the necessary folders to their locations :

1. copy the twitteroauth folder to the root location in your application .i.e. where the application and system folders are located
2. copy the files in the controller folder to your own controller folder. 
3.copy the files in the libraries folder to your own application/libraries folder , do the same for views

that is all , to test the app , load the application http://yourhost/your_root_folder/index


*all files prefixed with ci_twitter are core files , the rest are basically for testing*
